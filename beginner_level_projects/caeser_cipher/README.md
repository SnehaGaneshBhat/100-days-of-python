# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption/decryption technique in which each letter of a message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

---

## Description

- Allows the user to **encrypt** a message by shifting letters forward by a chosen value.
- Allows the user to **decrypt** a message by shifting letters backward by the same value.
- **Non-letter characters** (spaces, punctuation, etc.) remain unchanged.
- The program runs in a **loop** until the user chooses to exit.

---

## Features

- Implemented using **Python**.
- Demonstrates key programming concepts such as:
  - Looping
  - Lists and indexing
  - String manipulation
- Fully **case-insensitive**: the input message is converted to lowercase before processing.

---

## How to Use

- Run the script using any Python 3.x interpreter.
- Follow the prompts in the terminal:
   - Choose whether to encode or decode.
   - Enter your message.
   - Enter the shift value.
- View the result and choose whether to restart.

---

## Example
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:

encode
Type your message:

hello

Type the shift number:

3

Here is the encoded result: khoor

Do you want to restart the cipher? yes or no.no

Good bye
